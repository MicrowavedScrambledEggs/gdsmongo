# gdsmongo
Search site for genotype database like genotypedatasearch, except runs on Python 2.7 with a MongoDB backend
-----

Uses library django-non-rel 1.6 with MongoDB-engine. Both these libraries only compatible with Python 2, hence why this is a seperate project and not a branch of genotypedatasearch
